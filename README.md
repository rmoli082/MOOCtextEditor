# MOOCtextEditor
### by Rob Molinaro

A simple text editor created during the Coursera Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization. The text editor allows for the generation of random text using Markov text prediction, as well as the implementation of an autocorrect function. The editor also generates the Flesch Readability Index score of the entered text.
